# Example Alpha Whale Addresses for Testing
# Replace these with real whale addresses from Polymarket

# How to find real whales:
# 1. Visit https://polymarket.com/leaderboard
# 2. Look for users with high accuracy (65%+) and many trades (50+)
# 3. Click on their profile
# 4. Copy their wallet address from the URL or profile page

# Example format (these are placeholder addresses):
# 0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678
# 0xabcdefabcdefabcdefabcdefabcdefabcdefabcd
# 0x9876543210fedcba9876543210fedcba98765432

# For testing, you can use any valid Ethereum address
# The bot will try to fetch their profile and positions from Polymarket
